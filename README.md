## Installation

This repository uses the standard Python scientific stack (NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, etc.) and the [`opinf`](https://willcox-research-group.github.io/rom-operator-inference-Python3) package.
We recommend installing the required packages in a new [conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

```shell
$ conda deactivate
$ conda create -n gpbayesopinf python=3.12
$ conda activate gpbayesopinf
(gpbayesopinf) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Reproducing Numerical Results

Each of the three numerical experiments detailed in the paper is contained in its own folder.

- Compressible Euler equations: [**PDEs/**](./PDEs/)
- Nonlinear diffusion-reaction equation: [**PDEsMulti/**](./PDEsMulti/)
- SEIRD epidemiological model: [**ODEs/**](./ODEs/)

To reproduce the figures in the paper, navigate to the directory and run `experiments.sh`.

```shell
cd PDEs/
./experiments.sh
```
